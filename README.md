[FastGPT](https://github.com/labring/FastGPT) is a knowledge-based platform built on the LLMs, offers a comprehensive suite of out-of-the-box capabilities such as data processing, RAG retrieval, and visual AI workflow orchestration, letting you easily develop and deploy complex question-answering systems without the need for extensive setup or configuration.

The system tools previously utilized in FastGPT have been migrated to this repository, and future development of new tools will also be conducted within this repository.
